# Weather Backend App

This project is part of my Thesis named "Development of a software architecture for an agrometeorological network".
The idea of this module is provide the rest api service to persist and get information from a NoSql data base, for my
study case, we use MongoDB.

The objective of the Thesis is create an architectural model of software focused on the management of agrometeorological data that allows the scalability, that is to say, to add characteristics, climatic stations and maintenance, without the need to modify the established model, by applying software patterns, which together made the appropriate architectural model.
